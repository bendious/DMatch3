Simple Match-3 game made as a birthday gift for my niece, who asked whether I could make her "a Pokemon and mermaids game". :D

Unfortunately the quality difference between the images I could find for the two categories was... *stark*. That's the reason they're split into two separate modes rather than being together.

I had many more features I wanted to implement, too - extra long matches == evolutions! - but had to cut it off due to being already well past the "deadline" of her birthday. C'est la vie.
